## Before You Start

Before you begin the process of buying a shotgun, consider the following prerequisites:

1. **Legal Eligibility:**
   - Ensure that you are legally eligible to own a firearm. This includes being of legal age (usually 18 or 21 years old) and not having any disqualifying criminal convictions.
   - Check local regulations for any additional requirements specific to your area.

2. **Purpose and Type:**
   - Determine the purpose of your shotgun. Are you using it for hunting, sport shooting, or home defense?
   - Research different types of shotguns (e.g., pump-action, semi-automatic, break-action) to find one that suits your needs.

## How to Purchase a Shotgun

1. **Visit a Licensed Dealer:**
   - Locate a licensed firearms dealer (FFL) in your area. FFLs are authorized to sell firearms legally.
   - Visit the dealer's store or website to explore available shotguns.

2. **Choose Your Shotgun:**
   - Consider factors such as gauge (e.g., 12-gauge, 20-gauge), barrel length, and action type.
   - Handle different models to find one that feels comfortable and suits your intended use.

3. **Complete the Required Forms:**
   - Fill out ATF Form 4473 (Firearms Transaction Record). This form collects information about you and the firearm.
   - The dealer will perform a background check using the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).

4. **Waiting Period and Approval:**
   - Depending on your location, there may be a waiting period before you can take possession of the shotgun.
   - If approved, the dealer will provide you with the necessary paperwork.

5. **Purchase and Transfer:**
   - Pay for the shotgun and any associated fees (background check, transfer fee, etc.).
   - The dealer will complete the transfer process, ensuring compliance with all legal requirements.

6. **Secure Storage:**
   - Safely store your shotgun when not in use. Use a gun safe or lockbox to prevent unauthorized access.
   - Educate yourself on safe handling and storage practices.

7. **Register (if required):**
   - Some states require firearm registration. Check local laws to see if registration is necessary.
   - Follow the registration process if applicable.

8. **Learn and Practice:**
   - Take a firearms safety course to learn proper handling, maintenance, and shooting techniques.
   - Regularly practice at a shooting range to improve your skills.

Remember that responsible firearm ownership includes proper storage, maintenance, and adherence to safety guidelines. Always follow local laws and regulations, and seek professional advice if needed.
