# Bullet Basics: Understanding Sizes, Types, and Calibers

Modern small arms ammunition can be confusing due to the myriad common types, calibers, and sizes involved. However, with a little research, navigating the ‚Äúbullet aisle‚Äù at your local gun store becomes straightforward. Let's dive into the essentials.

## The History of Bullets

Ready-to-fire cartridge-based ammunition has been around for just over 200 years. Swiss gunsmith Jean Samuel Pauly is usually credited with making the first integrated ‚Äúneedle-fired‚Äù round in 1808. By the time of the Civil War, both breechloading longarms and revolvers were in circulation throughout the United States, all using cartridges instead of cap-and-ball black powder muzzle-loaded rounds.

## Bullet Calibers, Millimeters, or Gauge?

All modern firearms list the bullet chamber size either on the frame/receiver or the barrel. On pistols, revolvers, and rifles made in the U.S. or Great Britain, that size will typically be listed in terms of 1/100th (hundredth of an inch), a portion deemed a ‚Äúcaliber.‚Äù

## Bullet Types: FMJ? JHP? What does it mean?

- **FMJ (Full Metal Jacket)**: A common type of bullet where the lead core is fully encased in a copper or other metal jacket. FMJ bullets are used for target shooting and practice.
- **JHP (Jacketed Hollow Point)**: Designed for self-defense, JHP bullets have a hollow point that expands upon impact, creating a larger wound channel.
- **SP (Soft Point)**: Similar to JHP but with a partially exposed lead tip. Used for hunting.
- **AP (Armor-Piercing)**: Designed to penetrate armor or hard targets.
- **Tracer**: Contains a pyrotechnic compound that ignites upon firing, leaving a visible trail. Used for military purposes.
